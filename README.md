#ShoppingCart

In this activity, you will be creating a simple shopping cart. The shopping cart component contains two sections:

Stock: This is a list of the available products that can be added to your cart. Products are displayed as buttons in the following format: product: available stock (example: Apple:2)

Shopping Cart: This is a list of products that have been added to the cart
Users can click any product in the Stock list, and if that product is in stock, it will be added to the cart.
